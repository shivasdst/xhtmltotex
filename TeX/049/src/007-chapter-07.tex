\section*{A2.12 Translations}

The preface to \textit{A Rasa Reader} discusses the translation method: “The aim of producing as readable a sourcebook as possible has encouraged me to really try to translate the thought as well as the words of our authors. I therefore put into the translation what is implied in the text...”(Pollock 2016e:xviii) What the Indians thought “implicitly” would be the same as what the West thought explicitly and what our three–dimensional philologist has been thinking all his life: “But let me cut into the problem via the political–cultural dimension that has been my focus throughout.”(Pollock 1996b:239)
