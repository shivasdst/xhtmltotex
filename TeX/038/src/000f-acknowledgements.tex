\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

Our conferences could not have happened without the active support and participation of our volunteers and well-wishers.

We wish to thank Shri.\ Adarsh Chatra and his entire team from the Vande Mataram Student Circle at IIT-Madras for their help in making full arrangements and volunteering for various activities during the conference. Their spontaneous and active support was truly wonderful. Smt.\ Shanthi Durga Pai was an extraordinary resource and we extend our deepest gratitude to her for the help she provided us. Shri. Aditya Agrawalâ€™s presence and participation was invaluable for the number of responsibilities he handled for us to ensure that the conference was conducted successfully and smoothly. His contribution is priceless.

We are grateful to all the paper-presenters and the keen audience for maintaining a high academic standard and decorum at the conference. There are of course many more who have helped us and guided us behind the scenes and deserve our hearty thanks.
