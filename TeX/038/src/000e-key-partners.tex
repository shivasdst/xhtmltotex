The organisers of the conference are indebted to the various institutions and individuals for the invaluable help rendered by them, without which this work would just not have been possible. It is a pleasure to thank them heartily for the same.

We are deeply indebted to our individual and institutional sponsors: Shri.\ Mohandas Pai and Foundation for Indian Civilization Studies, Shri.\ MV Subbiah and Vellayan Chettiar Trust, Shri.\ J K Jhaver, Shri.\ Vallabh Bhanshali, Shri.\ Rakesh Bhandari, Shri.\ Nagesh Bhandari and Indus University. We are also grateful to Shri.\ Punit Modhgil, Shri.\ G Rajaraman, Shri.\ M.R Krishnakumar, Dr.\ Mahesh Krishnamurthy and others for their significant donations to us. Without all their financial support and help we would not have been able to attract the high level of scholarship that has contributed to this volume.

We are grateful to IITâ€“Madras for organizing the Swadeshi Indology Conference 3. In particular, we are thankful to Prof.\ Devendra Jalihal, Prof.\ Shreepad Karmalkar, Prof.\ Jyotirmaya Tripathy and many of their colleagues at IITM for helping us in the preparations and conduct of the conference. The teams at these institutions put in enormous efforts to make the conference a success and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude for the same.
