It gives me great pleasure to write this ‘Foreword’ for the book\break “World's Invisible Enemy: Diabetes” by Dr. V. Lakshminara\-yan and his son Dr. Sooraj Tejaswi. I have known Dr. Lakshminarayan for many years and admire him for his deep knowledge of medicine in general, and diabetes, in particular. He is a good speaker, a talented writer, an excellent clinician and above all a great human being. I have always been struck by his humi\-lity, his passion for excellence and his deep sense of humility. It is therefore a great pleasure for me to write a Foreword to his book.

Today, diabetes has become a global epidemic and India has\break the second largest number of people with diabetes in the world,\break 72.9 million, according to IDF Atlas 2017. Moreover, it has also an even larger number of people with pre–diabetes (77.4 million). Diabetes is no longer a disease of the rich, the old or urban people. The epidemic is rapidly shifting to younger ages, to rural areas and to the poor.\break This places a huge burden on not only the individual, family and the\break society but also the nation, as a whole. A century ago, there was an adage, “Know syphilis and know medicine”. Today, this could be\break changed to ‘Know diabetes and know medicine’ because diabetes has its ramifications all over the body and produces numerous complications. Moreover it is known as ‘a good di\-sease with bad companions’ because seve\-ral co–morbidities like hypertension, dyslipidemia,\break obesity, cardiovascular disease and stroke, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and even some forms of cancers are associated with diabetes. Therefore the title of Dr. Lakshminarayan’s book “World's Invisible\break Enemy: Diabetes” is appropriate. A thorough understanding of diabetes, its early detection, prevention and control can help not only individuals with diabetes, but also those with associated diseases and compli\-cations. This book covers all aspects of diabetes starting with history of diabetes, the acute and chronic complications of diabetes and various aspects of treatment of the disorder. I congra\-tulate Dr. Lakshminarayan and Dr. Tejaswi on this exce\-llent publication and wish them all the very best with its publication.
