The I took the Hereculean task of translating adverbation this sacred ancient text.

I cannot really imageine why I undertook this project. First and formost, I profusely thank my guide Smt. Mangala Nagraj who has my mentor for the last fifteen years. Her knowledge of the Kannada language has enabled me to compile this text in English.

My source of inspiration perhaps may have been Major Ramanujam who is an exponent of the Vedas and the Upanishads but he does not know Kannada. Smt. Mangala has been an ardent devotee of her Guru and holds him in high esteem and extreme reverence and often quotes his words while teaching us in class.

This work has given me immense pleasure and an opportunity ton test my skill and discipline.

I will be failing in my duty if I do not extend my gratitude to our senior student Smt. Sharadamma an eighty year old lady who handed over this 1927 edition of, “Upanishad Sara Ratnavali” written by Mysore Shivananda Subramanya.

I hope this effort will benefit the spiritual seekers and the larger public in general.

I have put in my best efforts in the translation with my limited knowledge of Kannada and the surpictures

[SARVAM KHALVIDAM BRAHMA]

Sloka:॥

 Atmanatma Vivekena Punasamsara Nivrith~।
 Tadirna Janma Kotyapi Bandhachledho Na Sidhiyeti~॥

Those who do not have the viveka or a sense of discexament even if they take birtha even a crore times will not attain moksha. Therefore, “Anthatatmana Manjanadristva~। Brahamantimudha girigahavrishu” as per the above, one must analize what kind of a body it is and the atma which resides in it.

‘Aaya Matmabrahma~। atma Narayana Para’. As per this Shruti, Atma itself is Parabrahma, and the one who experiences this atma, even if he goes to vanavasa and stands upside down, and does Tapas and however much he may undergo the hardships as also foregoing food and water he will not achieve Mukti.

(Agnanam Bhavanarthaya Pratima Parikalpika).

The one who is ignosant needs to do idol worship, those who are Atma–Gnanis do not need this idol worship.

 “Deho Devalaya Proktojivo Devasnatana~।
 Tyajeda Gnana Nirmalyam Soham Bhavene Pujeyeth~॥”

The one who realises that this body itself is a devalaya or a temple and the atma which dwells within is the Parabrahma and who understands this Brahmatma and becomes one with it, they will be free from the cycle of rebirth, become Nitya Muktas and get Moksha. However, those who undertake physical and mental hardships are incapable of attaining Mukti.

Hey! Priya Sahodaras, all of you please read through this whole Grantha. Please try to comprehend the various Upanidic Vakyas and I request that only Brahmdaivata Gnana is all in all the sum and substance, I sincerely pray to all of you to understand.

Thus, the author of this Grantha's request, the Mumukshus will not delay in reading this sacred treatise. This grantha is concise and is small but the contents are amogha or wonderful and its usefulness to all the readers is of the highest order and can be understand even to a non–vedic or the common man even to the Mahatmas will have an appeal to this book.

This Grantha contains (44) subjects. Everyone of them without fail has a beauty of its own. I will show this in the next Vishayasuchaka Patrika.

I offer my gratitude to Sri Bandikeri Karannara's children Rajeyri and also the owner of a small shop Ramaiah who contributed financially thus enabling the publication, and to the Granthakartaru and to his family the blessings of Sri Sachitananda swarupa Parmeshwara to shower his good wishes to them.

I humbly apologise if there have been any lapses in this grantha and request the mahapurushas who read this to overlook them.

An announcement:–

I would like to make it clear, that in this grantha, the notes and meanings written in Kannada if by any chance if any one tries to pilfer the inner meanings of Srimad Bhagwat Gita, the Vedanta Granthas' notes and This will facicilate you to see the subjects you need very soon.

In this Grantha, I have included Sri Shankaracharya's shlokas: viz, (1) Prathasmarana stotra (2) Manusha Panchaka (3) Ekashloki (4) Kaupina Panchaka (5) Sadhana Panchaka.

For all the above shlokas, notes in Kannada have been adequately provided. These will immensely help the Mumukshus in their quest for Atma Sandhana which will prove very useful. The meanigns of this stotras will comfilement those stated in the various Upanishads.
