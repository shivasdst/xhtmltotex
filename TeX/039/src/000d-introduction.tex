Sri MadGuruSwamy has reflected in his mind.

Srimadnantha Nigamantha Vedya SatyaGnanananda Swarupa, who is Nitya Nirmala Sri Ramachandra Parabrahma has elaborately described the dialogue between Sri Ram and Hanumantha. This conversation is in the form of Vedasara Upanishad's.

Tatparya and madguruswamy combineed all the above in a very lasy way for the common man to comprehend; it is called “Upanishadth Sara Ratnavali”

It is our humble request that everyones life should be enlightened the hearts of all.
