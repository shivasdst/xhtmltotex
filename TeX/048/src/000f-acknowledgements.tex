\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

Our conferences could not have happened without the active support and participation of our well–wishers and volunteers.

We extend our thanks to Smt. Vrinda Acharya for her enormous efforts in making SI–5 a success. We are extremely thankful to Dr. T. S. Sathyavathi for all her inspirational and invaluable guidance and inputs in all aspects relating to the conference.

We also wish to thank Skandaprasad, Megha Bhat, Sucheta Tejaswi and Rakshita for their help in making full arrangements and volunteering for various activities during the conference. We absolutely could not have succeeded without their spontaneous and active support on the ground at the event.

We are grateful to all the paper–presenters and the keen audience for maintaining a high academic standard and decorum at the conference. There of course are many more who have helped us and guided us behind the scenes and deserve our hearty thanks.
